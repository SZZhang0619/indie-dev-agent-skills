# System Analysis

## Purpose
This document defines the system boundaries, core concepts, workflows,
assumptions, and constraints.
It serves as the root specification and source-of-truth for all other
specification documents.

## Scope

### In Scope
- Core system responsibilities
- Actors and external dependencies
- High-level components and their responsibilities
- Primary workflows and state transitions

### Out of Scope
- Visual design details
- Implementation-level code structure
- Project management or roadmap planning

## Project Snapshot

### One-liner
(One sentence describing what this system does.)

### Primary Users
- User type A — main goal
- User type B — main goal

### Primary Outcomes
- Observable outcome 1
- Observable outcome 2

## Assumptions & Constraints

### Assumptions
- [A-1] ...
- [A-2] ...
- [A-3] ...

### Constraints
- [C-1] Platform constraints (e.g. mobile/web)
- [C-2] Network / offline constraints
- [C-3] Data, privacy, or security constraints

## Actors & External Dependencies

### Actors
- Actor A (human/system) — responsibility
- Actor B (human/system) — responsibility

### External Dependencies
- Dependency A — purpose — failure impact
- Dependency B — purpose — failure impact

## System Components (Conceptual)

### Component A
- Responsibility:
- Inputs:
- Outputs:

### Component B
- Responsibility:
- Inputs:
- Outputs:

### Component C
- Responsibility:
- Inputs:
- Outputs:

- Preconditions:
- Steps:
  1. ...
  2. ...
  3. ...
  4. ...
- Postconditions:
- Failure cases:
  - F-1 ...
  - F-2 ...

### WF-2: Workflow name
- Trigger:
- Preconditions:
- Steps:
  1. ...
  2. ...
  3. ...
  4. ...
- Postconditions:
- Failure cases:
  - F-1 ...
  - F-2 ...

### WF-3: Workflow name
- Trigger:
- Preconditions:
- Steps:
  1. ...
  2. ...
  3. ...
  4. ...
- Postconditions:
- Failure cases:
  - F-1 ...
  - F-2 ...

## State & Lifecycle (if applicable)

### Entity: (e.g. Item / Task / Session)
- States:
  - S1:
  - S2:
- Allowed transitions:
  - S1 → S2 when ...
- Invalid transitions:
  - ...
