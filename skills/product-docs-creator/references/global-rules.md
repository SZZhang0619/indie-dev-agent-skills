# Global Writing Rules (All Docs)

## Consistency
- Use the same terminology across documents.
- If a concept changes, update the glossary first.

## Traceability
- Every document must state:
  - Purpose
  - Scope (In/Out)
  - Assumptions & Open Questions

## No Hidden Assumptions
- If you are not sure, write:
  - [A-x] Assumption, or
  - [Q-x] Open Question

## Actionability
- Prefer content that can be converted into:
  - tasks
  - tests
  - interfaces
- Avoid motivational or marketing language unless explicitly requested.

## Formatting
- Markdown headings only (H1–H3 preferred)
- Bullets for lists, numbered steps for workflows
- Use stable IDs like WF-1, A-1, Q-1 for later cross-references
